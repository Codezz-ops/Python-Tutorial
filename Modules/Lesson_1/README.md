# Lesson 1: Hello, World in Python

## Introduction
Welcome to the first lesson of our Python learning journey! In this lesson, we'll introduce you to the most basic and fundamental concept in programming: printing text to the console. This is often the first step in learning any new programming language, as it helps you get familiar with the syntax and structure of the language.

# Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will:

- Understand the basic structure of a Python program.
- Learn how to use the print() function to display text on the screen.
- Explore the use of escape sequences in strings.

# Writing Your First Python Program
Open your preferred code editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE). If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can create a new file with the `.py` extension, which indicates that it's a Python file.

# The `print()` Function
In Python, the `print()` function is used to output text to the console. The text to be printed is placed inside the parentheses, and you can include variables, expressions, or even multiple arguments separated by commas.

# Hello, World!
Let's start with a simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Here's how you can do it:
```py
print("Hello, World!")
```
When you run this program, you should see the text "Hello, World!" displayed in your console or terminal.

## Using Escape Sequences
In Python, you can use escape sequences to include special characters in your strings. For example, the newline character `\n` can be used to start a new line. Let's modify our "Hello, World!" program to print "Hello, World!" followed by a newline and then "Welcome to Python!".
```py
print("Hello, World!\nWelcome to Python!")
```
When you run this program, you'll notice that "Hello, World!" and "Welcome to Python!" are printed on separate lines.

# Conclusion
Congratulations! You've just written your first Python program. This is a significant milestone in your programming journey. From here, you can explore more complex concepts such as variables, data types, control flow, and functions. Remember, the key to mastering programming is practice. Keep experimenting with different code snippets, and don't hesitate to seek help if you encounter any challenges.
