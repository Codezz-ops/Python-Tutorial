# Lesson 1: Introduction to Python
# This script demonstrates a simple "Hello, world!" program in Python.

# The print function is used to output text to the console.
# The string "Hello, world!\n" is passed as an argument to print.
# The "\n" at the end of the string is an escape character that adds a new line after the output.
print("Hello, world!\n")
