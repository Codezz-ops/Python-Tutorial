# Python - High level interpreted language

## Introduction
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that was developed in the late 1990s by Guido van Rossum. It was designed with the goal of being easy to read and write, emphasizing code readability and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be possible in languages such as C++ or Java. Python's design philosophy also emphasizes the importance of simplicity and the use of English keywords where possible, making it accessible to beginners and experienced programmers alike.

Python's simplicity and readability have contributed to its widespread adoption across various domains, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more. Its versatility and the vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks available for Python have further solidified its position as a go-to language for many developers.

One of the key features of Python is its dynamic typing system, which allows variables to hold values of any type without requiring explicit declaration of the variable's type. This feature, combined with Python's support for multiple programming paradigms (including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming), makes Python a highly flexible language that can be used for a wide range of applications.

Python's standard library is another area where it shines, providing a wide array of modules and functions for tasks such as file I/O, system calls, sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user interface (GUI) toolkits. This extensive standard library, along with the vast third-party libraries available through the Python Package Index (PyPI), has enabled Python to become a powerful tool for developing complex applications.


## Setting Up Your Environment

Before you start coding, you need to set up your Python environment.

### Installing Coding Environment

- **Visual Studio Code**: Download the Installer from the [official Vscode website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 

After installing Visual Studio Code, use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + X` to open the Extensions view. Search for "Python" and install the most downloaded extension.

### Installing python 

- **Windows**: Download the installer from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
- **macOS**: Use Homebrew by running `brew install python` in the terminal.
- **Linux**: Use your distribution's package manager, e.g., `sudo apt-get install python3` for Ubuntu.
